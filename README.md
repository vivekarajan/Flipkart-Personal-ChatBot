##  Overall Perspective:
Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart Private Limited was established as a private limited company in Singapore and has its headquarters located in Bangalore. Prior to branching out into other product categories like consumer electronics, fashion, household necessities, food, and lifestyle items, the company concentrated on selling books online. Everybody uses the Flipkart app and website. one of the top platforms for online shopping. We are able to search for anything there. There are other functions, such as voice and image searches.

##  What's New (Objective):
Here, I try the new prototype for the benefit of the end consumers. Every individual has their own dataset or set of data pertaining to purchases, returns, and other attributes. I also have a suggestion for getting to these facts using voice commands. The application will retrieve the relevant information for those commands if you offer them voice commands. As a result, this application is only a prototype and has to be implemented further.

## Application Overview:
By choosing the options in the Flipkart application, we can all view our information. so perhaps this will be that app's next upgrade.
